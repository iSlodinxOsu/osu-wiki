While most osu! players stick to clicking circles and whacking keys, [osu!mania aficionado **Midian**](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/25689815) has taken his osu! journey a step further by producing music used in our game!

Tournaments like *osu!mania Malaysia Tournament*, *Enders Nightly Deathmatch*, *Asia Sujii Cup*, and *EPIC.LAN* have already adopted **Midian**'s sound, so it was only a matter of time before his wildly variable electronic and instrumental tunes found their way to our Featured Artist collection.

More specifically, **8** tracks now sit in [**Midian**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/443). Once someone maps them, those tracks will sit in your osu! library too.

Luckily for you, [nik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10077264) and [Ilham](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3057154) got a headstart by crafting two maps specifically for this announcement! Check them out, plus everything else down here:

Just like rhythm, [**Midian**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/443) is just a \*click\* away. All of his official osu! tunes can be found there as pre-timed beatmap templates, so do that click already.

Anyone in the loop knows that we announce new Featured Artists every weekend. Stay tuned for that!
